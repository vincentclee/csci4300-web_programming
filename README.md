Blended class format: CSCI 4300 is a “blended” class, meaning that the instruc on will be a combina on of lecture, online learning resources, in-class
exercises, and student presenta ons. I shall endeavor to minimize in-class lecture me and maximize student par cipa on.

Coopera ve class blog: Deciphering error messages is a key skill in any kind of so ware development. In this class, we will set up a coopera ve “Bug
Hunt” blog in which you can discuss error messages with other students. The tle of each blog thread should be an error message that came up in your
work. That way, another student can use the blog entries as a resource for understanding their own errors. In your blog entries please address both
why the error occurs (including the defini ons of any possibly obscure terms in the error message) and how to fix it.
Each student should make at least five entries (either new threads or comments) during the semester. Your grade will be based partly on peer
evalua ons of your entries. You may earn up to 5 points extra credit for blogging above and beyond the call of duty!
Presenta ons: Mondays will be reserved for Q & A and student presenta ons. You will work in teams of two (some mes three if odd numbers of
students mess up my system) and present twice during the semester. I will discuss the art of giving a good technical presenta on in the first lecture.
In-class exercises: These will be done in pairs (or threesomes, again). You will make an ini al submission at the end of the class period and a final
submission when you finish the exercise. No ce that this means that you MUST come to class and stay to the end! Bring a good book if you are the type
who finishes a two-hour project in less than 45 minutes on a regular basis.
Academic	Honesty
In-class Exercises: These are started in class and completed on your own, in teams or two or more. You may discuss these with other students and help
other students with coding problems. You may not copy other students’ code or write code for other students. You may not get help from any other
person or copy code from any source, unless the exercise direc ons specifically allow it. Please do not work on your individual assignments, or ask
ques ons about them, during class me.
Individual Assignments: These are completed on your own, en rely outside of class. You may discuss ideas with other students. You may not work
together with other students, help other students with code, copy other students’ code, or write code for other students. You may not get help from
any other person or copy code from any other source, unless the assignment direc ons specifically allow it.
Group Project: You may work together with other students in your group and help other students with their code, but each module (class or func on)
must have a single author, iden fied with a comment in the code. You may not copy other students’ code, or write code for other students. You may
not work with students outside your group, except to discuss ideas (no code!) You may not get help from any other person or copy code from any other
source, unless the assignment direc ons specifically allow it.
Content from outside this class: You may not copy any code from any other source, such as the textbook or examples from the Web, without specific
authoriza on from the instructor. Any content from an external source, including images, must be acknowledged in your code.
Enforcement: if I suspect that a viola on of these rules has occurred, I will first discuss it with the students involved. If a er this discussion it s ll
appears that a viola on has occurred, I will handle the ma er according to the UGA Academic Honesty Guidelines (h p://www.uga.edu/honesty/).
During any hearings I will ask for a penalty of an F in the course.
Readings and online materials: The class schedule below lists only the textbook readings. Consult eLC for addi onal online resources as we proceed.
