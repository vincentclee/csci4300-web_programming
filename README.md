##CSCI 4300 Web Programming

###Spring 4300
**Instructor:** Dr. Dan Everett, drdan@uga.edu  
**Office Hours:** M 3:15 – 4:00, TR 1:00 – 2:00 in Boyd 418; other times by appointment  
**Teaching Assistant:** TBA  
**Text and online readings:** Java Servlets and JSP by Murach, 2nd ed. Additional online readings and videos will be provided on eLC. The textbook readings are listed in the class schedule below.  
**Blended class format:** CSCI 4300 is a “blended” class, meaning that the instruction on will be a combination of lecture, online learning resources, in-class exercises, and student presentations. I shall endeavor to minimize in-class lecture me and maximize student participation.

**Cooperative class blog:** Deciphering error messages is a key skill in any kind of software development. In this class, we will set up a cooperative “Bug Hunt” blog in which you can discuss error messages with other students.  The title of each blog thread should be an error message that came up in your work. That way, another student can use the blog entries as a resource for understanding their own errors. In your blog entries please address both
why the error occurs (including the deﬁnitions of any possibly obscure terms in the error message) and how to ﬁx it.

Each student should make at least ﬁve entries (either new threads or comments) during the semester. Your grade will be based partly on peer evaluations of your entries. You may earn up to 5 points extra credit for blogging above and beyond the call of duty!

**Presentations:** Mondays will be reserved for Q & A and student presentations. You will work in teams of two (sometimes three if odd numbers of students mess up my system) and present twice during the semester. I will discuss the art of giving a good technical presentation in the ﬁrst lecture.

**In-class exercises:** These will be done in pairs (or threesomes, again). You will make an initial submission at the end of the class period and a ﬁnal submission when you ﬁnish the exercise. Notice that this means that you MUST come to class and stay to the end! Bring a good book if you are the type who ﬁnishes a two-hour project in less than 45 minutes on a regular basis.

####Academic Honesty
**In-class Exercises:** These are started in class and completed on your own, in teams or two or more. You may discuss these with other students and help other students with coding problems. You may not copy other students’ code or write code for other students.  You may not get help from any other person or copy code from any source, unless the exercise directions speciﬁcally allow it. Please do not work on your individual assignments, or ask questions about them, during class time.

**Individual Assignments:** These are completed on your own, entirely outside of class. You may discuss ideas with other students. You may not work together with other students, help other students with code, copy other students’ code, or write code for other students. You may not get help from any other person or copy code from any other source, unless the assignment directions speciﬁcally allow it.

**Group Project:** You may work together with other students in your group and help other students with their code, but each module (class or function) must have a single author, identiﬁed with  a comment in the code. You may not copy other students’ code, or write code for other students. You may not work with students outside your group, except to discuss ideas (no code!) You may not get help from any other person or copy code from any other source, unless the assignment directions speciﬁcally allow it.

**Content from outside this class:** You may not copy any code from any other source, such as the textbook or examples from the Web, without speciﬁc authorization from the instructor. Any content from an external source, including images, must be acknowledged in your code.

**Enforcement:** if I suspect that a violation of these rules has occurred, I will ﬁrst discuss it with the students involved. If after this discussion it still appears that a violation has occurred, I will handle the matter according to the UGA Academic Honesty Guidelines (http://www.uga.edu/honesty/). During any hearings I will ask for a penalty of an F in the course.
